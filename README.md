# github-activity-booster
Something to automatically fill your git activity log to all green.

Could be implemented as an alternative git API to python. At its core, it will be Selenium or Webbot. But, pretty sure I wont bother
making a reduntant API. 

Run create_new_repo.py first.
Schedule a task to run upload_files.py once every three hours.
Read readme.txt for more info.


Dependencies:
  - selenium
  - essential-generators
  - a whole bunch of libraries for gmailv1-api for python
  - httplib2
  - oauth2client


PM if you found any bugs.
